# WARNING: INCOMPLETE, UGLY CODE.

The following is an example on how to use asynchronous multi-processing
in the [l2rpn](https://l2rpn.chalearn.org/) challenge. It's taken
directly from my current approach to it, and is therefore (a)
uncommented, (b) untested, (c) difficult to understand for anyone else.

For details on how to use it, check out `parallel_training.py`, which
shows both a training and an evaluation loop.

You're on your own to use this code - the likelihood I will answer
questions on it is minuscule. Also, any damages from using this code -
lost hours of work and/or sanity, CPU meltdowns, power grid blackouts,
summoning electrical elementals, etc - are on you. Nonetheless, I do
hope it helps you.
